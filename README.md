<ol>

 <li>For each of the following statements, give a valid proof if it is true for all relations and  over arbitrary sets . If the statement is not always true,</li>

</ol>

provide a counterexample.

If        and          are symmetric, then                    is symmetric.

If        and          are antisymmetric, then                     is antisymmetric.
